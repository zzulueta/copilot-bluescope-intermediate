## Part 1: Advanced Prompting Patterns (35 minutes)

### Exercise 1.1: Discover and Fix Bugs Using Copilot (15 min)

**Task:** Use Copilot to find bugs, then fix them with decomposition prompting

#### Step 1: Bug Discovery (5 min)

Use Copilot's review capabilities to discover issues in the codebase:

1. **Workspace-wide review:**
   Open Copilot Chat and drag the steel-inventory-api folder into the chat as context, then type:

   ```
   Review the application for any issues
   ```
   Review the suggestions and note any critical issues found. You should discover at least 3-5 issues.
   
   > Note: We added the steel-inventory-api to the context in order for Copilot to not read the LAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md file and flag it as a bug. This way, we can focus on the actual code files.

2. **Targeted file analysis:**
   For each key file, ask Copilot to analyze for common issues:
   ```
   Review database.py for potential bugs including:
   - Data validation issues
   - Missing error handling
   - State management problems
   ```
   
   ```
   Review routers/inventory.py for:
   - Input validation issues
   - Missing boundary checks
   - Error handling gaps
   ```
   
   ```
   Review steel_utils.py for:
   - Null/None handling issues
   - Type safety problems
   - Edge cases not handled
   ```

3. **Document your findings:**
   As Copilot identifies issues, note them down. You should discover bugs like:
   - Duplicate product codes not prevented
   - `last_updated` not set on updates
   - Negative quantities allowed
   - Crashes on None/null values

#### Step 2: Fix Bugs Using Decomposition (10 min)

Now fix the bugs you discovered using decomposition prompting. For this step, we will focus on 3 critical bugs. 
- Duplicate product codes not prevented in database.py
- No Negative Quantity Validation in routers/inventory.py
- Null Pointer in calculate_area_m2() for steel_utils.py

1. For each bug found, use this sample decomposition pattern in Copilot Chat:
   ```
   I need to fix the [bug description] in [file name]. Let's break this down:
   1. First, show me where [relevant code section]
   2. Then, suggest [solution approach]
   3. Finally, show where to add this [implementation]
   ```

2. Example for duplicate product code bug in database.py:
   ```
   I need to fix the duplicate product code bug in database.py. Let's break this down:
   1. First, show me where product codes are validated
   2. Then, suggest validation logic to check for duplicates
   3. Finally, show where to add this validation in the create method
   ```
   Open the relevant file, review the suggested validation logic, and implement it with Copilot's help.

3. Fix the other bugs using decomposition:
   - No Negative Quantity Validation in routers/inventory.py
   - Null Pointer in calculate_area_m2() for steel_utils.py

   For each bug, use decomposition:
   - Identify the problem location (already done in Step 1)
   - Understand the root cause
   - Propose a solution
   - Implement with Copilot's help

   Use the sample decomposition prompt for each bug.

**Expected Outcome:** 
- You've practiced using Copilot for code discovery at multiple levels
- All discovered bugs are fixed with clear, maintainable code
- You understand finding AND fixing issues with Copilot
- You've identified architectural improvements

**Commit:** 
Go to Source Control and use Copilot to generate a semantic commit message for your changes. Then Commit & Push your changes.

---

### Exercise 1.2: Test-First Development (10 min)

**Task:** Add comprehensive tests BEFORE implementing new features

1. Open `tests/test_inventory.py`. Close any other files to focus on testing.
2. In Copilot Chat, use test-first prompting:
```
Using TDD, I want to add a feature to search products by grade. 
First, write comprehensive tests for this feature including:
- Searching for existing grade
- Searching for non-existent grade
- Case-insensitive search
- Empty results handling

Don't implement the feature yet, just the tests.
```

3. Run the tests (they should fail):
```bash
pytest tests/test_inventory.py -v
```

4. Now ask Copilot to implement the feature to make tests pass:
```
Now implement the search_by_grade endpoint in routers/inventory.py to make these tests pass
```
5. Review the implementation, run tests again, and ensure they pass.

**Expected Outcome:** 
- Tests written first (failing)
- Feature implemented (tests passing)

**Commit:**
Go to Source Control and use Copilot to generate a semantic commit message for your changes. Then Commit & Push your changes.

---

### Exercise 1.3: Refactor-First Pattern (10 min)

**Task:** Refactor the steel_utils.py before adding new features

1. Open `app/utils/steel_utils.py`
2. Use refactor-first prompting:
```
I want to add weight calculations for coil, bar, and tube shapes.
Before adding new features, let's refactor the existing code:
1. Extract shape-specific calculations into separate functions
2. Add proper type hints
3. Add comprehensive docstrings
4. Add input validation

Show me the refactored structure first.
```

3. Review the refactoring suggestions
4. Apply the refactoring
5. NOW add the new calculations:
```
Now implement weight calculations for:
- coil (use rectangular approximation)
- bar (circular cross-section: π * r² * length * density)
- tube (hollow circular: π * (r_outer² - r_inner²) * length * density)
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Clean, well-structured code
- All shape types supported
- Proper documentation

**Commit:**
Go to Source Control and use Copilot to generate a semantic commit message for your changes. Then Commit & Push your changes.

---

## Part 2: GitHub Workflow Integration (15 minutes)

### Exercise 2.1: Create Feature Branch with PR (10 min)

1. Create a new feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/low-stock-alerts
```

2. Implement low stock alert feature. Ask Copilot:
```
Add a low stock alert feature:
1. Add a `min_stock_level` field to SteelProduct model
2. Create an endpoint GET /inventory/low-stock that returns products below their minimum
3. Add a field to track whether an alert has been sent
```
Implement the feature with Copilot's help.

**Commit:**
Go to Source Control and use Copilot to generate a semantic commit message for your changes. Then Commit & Push your changes.

---

### Exercise 2.2: Generate PR Summary (5 min)

1. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request for your feature branch against main. You should see a Compare & Pull Request button. Click it.
2. Use Copilot to generate a comprehensive PR description:

In Copilot Chat:
```
Generate a pull request description for the low-stock-alerts feature.
Include:

Summary of changes
Technical details
Testing done
Breaking changes (if any)
Use simple markdown formatting for readability. Do not provide links in the summary.
```

3. Copy the generated description to your PR

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Summary
Implements low stock alerting system for inventory management...

## Changes
- Added `min_stock_level` field to SteelProduct model
- Created `/inventory/low-stock` endpoint
...

## Testing
- Added unit tests for low stock detection
...
```

> Note: In the advanced course, we will use GitHub MCP Server to automate PR summary generation.
---

## Part 3: Custom Agents and Skills (40 minutes)

**Setup:** Switch back to the main branch before starting this section:
```bash
git checkout main
```

This ensures your custom agents and skills are available across all future branches.

---

### Exercise 3.1: Create Custom Agent (20 min)

**Task:** Create specialized agents for steel calculations from scratch using either the /create-agent command or manual creation.

1. Create **steel-expert.agent.md** in `.github/agents/` using /create-agent command:

Ask Copilot in **Agent** mode to help you structure it:
```
/create-agent I want to create a custom GitHub Copilot agent for steel manufacturing expertise.
Create an agent file called steel-expert.agent.md that:
- Specializes in steel grades, calculations, and specifications
- Has access to read and web tools
- Knows about ASTM and EN standards
- Can perform weight and dimension calculations
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 model
```
Verify the generated agent file in the **.github/agents directory**. If the file is generated elsewhere (e.g., project root), move it to: 
.github/agents/steel-expert.agent.md

It should have proper YAML frontmatter and a detailed description of the agent's capabilities similar to below:
```
name: steel-expert
description: "Steel manufacturing specialist. Use when: calculating steel weight, dimensions, or area; identifying steel grades; interpreting ASTM or EN standards; providing material specifications; performing metallurgical calculations; advising on steel properties"
tools: [read, web]
model: "Claude Sonnet 4.5"
argument-hint: "Ask about steel grades, calculations, or standards"
```

Review the following key sections in the generated agent file:
- **Description**: Should clearly state the agent's expertise in steel manufacturing, including knowledge of steel grades, standards, and calculations.
- **Tools**: Should include `read` and `web` tools for accessing information.
- **Model**: Should specify `Claude Sonnet 4.5`
- **Role**: Should outline the agent's role in answering questions related to steel products, calculations, and standards.

2. **Test your steel-expert agent:**
- In Copilot Chat select the **steel-expert** agent and ask it a question:
```
What's the weight of a 304 stainless steel sheet 2400x1200x6mm?
```

3. **Create inventory-manager.agent.md** with handoffs using /create-agent command:

Go back to **Agent mode**. Ask Copilot:
```
/create-agent Create an inventory-manager.agent.md that:
- Manages inventory operations
- Delegates calculations to steel-expert agent using handoffs
- Has access to read and web tools
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 model
```
Verify the generated agent file in the **.github/agents directory**. If the file is generated elsewhere, move it to the correct location.

Here is a sample structure for the inventory-manager agent with handoffs to steel-expert:
```
name: inventory-manager
description: "Inventory operations manager. Use when: managing steel inventory; adding or updating products; checking stock levels; organizing warehouse locations; tracking inventory movements; coordinating product data"
tools: [read, web, agent]
model: "Claude Sonnet 4.5"
argument-hint: "Describe inventory operation or product management task"
handoffs:
  - label: Send to steel expert
    agent: steel-expert
    prompt: Implement the needed computation
    send: true
```
> Note how the handoff is structured with a label, target agent, prompt, and send flag. The /create-agent command may not generate the handoff section correctly, so you may need to add it manually as shown above.

Review the following key sections in the generated agent file:
- **Description**: Should clearly state the agent's role in managing inventory operations, including delegating calculations to the steel-expert agent using handoffs. It should specify that this agent is responsible for inventory management tasks and will rely on the steel-expert for any calculations related to steel products.
- **Tools**: Should include `read` and `web` tools for accessing information.
- **Model**: Should specify `Claude Sonnet 4.5`
- **Handoffs**: Should include a handoff to the steel-expert agent for any calculations or technical questions related to steel products.
- **Role**: Should outline the agent's role in managing inventory operations and coordinating with the steel-expert agent for calculations.

4. **Test handoff between agents:**

Select the **inventory-manager** agent in Copilot Chat and ask it a question that requires a handoff:
```
Given this: A36 plate, 3000x1500x10mm, qty 50. 
What's its weight?
```

5. **Create quality-inspector.agent.md** manually for quality control:
```markdown
---
name: quality-inspector
description: Inspects steel products for defects and compliance
tools:
  - read
  - web
model: Claude Sonnet 4.5
---

You are a quality control specialist for steel manufacturing.

Your responsibilities:
- Inspect products for dimensional accuracy
- Verify material properties
- Check compliance with specifications
- Recommend corrective actions

Use precise measurements and cite quality standards (ASTM, ISO).
```

6. Select the **quality-inspector** agent in Copilot Chat and Test your new agent:
```
Check if a steel sheet with thickness 5.8mm meets the specification of 6mm ±0.3mm
```

7. Test **user-invocable** setting for steel-expert.

Go to the steel-expert.agent.md file and add `user-invocable: false` to the YAML frontmatter and save the file. Then try to invoke the steel-expert agent directly in Copilot Chat.

Example:
```
name: steel-expert
description: "Steel manufacturing specialist. Use when: calculating steel weight, dimensions, or area; identifying steel grades; interpreting ASTM or EN standards; providing material specifications; performing metallurgical calculations; advising on steel properties"
tools: [read, web]
model: "Claude Sonnet 4.5"
argument-hint: "Ask about steel grades, calculations, or standards"
user-invocable: false
```

Verify that the steel-expert agent is no longer available for direct invocation.
You should not see "steel-expert" in the agent selector dropdown in Copilot Chat.

8. Go to the inventory-manager agent and test that the handoff to steel-expert still works even after setting it to non-user-invocable:

Select the **inventory-manager** agent in Copilot Chat and ask it a question that requires a handoff:
```
Given this: A36 plate, 3000x1500x10mm, qty 50. 
What's its weight?
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Custom agents responding appropriately
- Handoff working between agents
- Specialized responses based on agent context

---

### Exercise 3.2: Create Agent Skills (20 min)

**Task:** Create portable skills following the agentskills.io standard from scratch using either the /create-skill command or manual creation.

1. Create **cost-estimation.skill** in `skills/cost-estimation/SKILL.md` using /create-skill command:

Ask Copilot:
```
/create-skill I want to create an agent skill following the agentskills.io standard.
Create a SKILL.md file for cost-estimation that:
- Has proper YAML frontmatter (name, description, author, version, agentSkillsVersion: 0.1.0)
- Calculates material costs, shipping expenses, and project estimates
- Includes formulas for material cost, shipping cost, and total cost
- Supports different pricing scenarios
- Includes usage examples with cost calculations
```
Things to verify:
- SKILL.md file is created in the correct location: `skills/cost-estimation/SKILL.md`
- YAML frontmatter is properly formatted and must have the following fields at minimum:
   - **Name**: Should be `cost-estimation` (must match the directory name)
   - **Description**: Should clearly explain that this skill calculates material costs, shipping expenses, and project estimates for steel products.

2. **Test the cost-estimation skill:**

Open a new Copilot Chat, select the **Agent** mode and ask it to use the cost-estimation skill:
```
Use the cost-estimation skill to estimate total cost:
Product: A36 plate 3000x1500x10mm
Quantity: 50 units
Unit weight: 353.25 kg
Steel price: $0.85/kg
Shipping distance: 500 km at $0.12/kg/100km
```

3. Create **inventory-optimization.skill** in `skills/inventory-optimization/SKILL.md` manually.

Create a directory called `inventory-optimization` under `skills/` and add a `SKILL.md` file with the following content:

```markdown
---
name: inventory-optimization
description: Optimize inventory levels and reorder points
---

# Inventory Optimization Skill

Provides recommendations for optimal inventory management.

## Capabilities

- Calculate reorder points
- Suggest optimal stock levels
- Identify slow-moving inventory
- Forecast demand

## Usage

Invoke when:
- Planning inventory levels
- Analyzing stock turnover
- Optimizing warehouse space

## Examples
Calculate reorder point for:
- Product: STL-001
- Lead time: 7 days
- Daily usage: 5 units
- Safety stock: 20 units

## Formula
Reorder Point = (Lead Time × Daily Usage) + Safety Stock
```

4. **Test the new skill:**
```
Use the inventory-optimization skill to calculate reorder point:
lead time 7 days, daily usage 10 units, safety stock 50 units
```

5. Add progressive loading to your skills. Modify the computation of the inventory-optimization skill to load seasonality data from a file before performing the calculation. 

Modify the later part of the SKILL.md file:

```
## Formula
Reorder Point = (Lead Time × Daily Usage) * Seasonality Factor + Safety Stock

Determine the Seasonality Factor based on the current month using the seasonality rules defined in `seasonality.md`.
```

Then create a `seasonality.md` file in the same directory with the following content:

```markdown
If December: Seasonality Factor = 1.2
Otherwise: Seasonality Factor = 1.0
```
6. Test that the inventory-optimization skill correctly applies the seasonality factor based on the current month when calculating the reorder point.
Create a new Copilot Chat and ask:
```
Use the inventory-optimization skill to calculate reorder point:
lead time 7 days, daily usage 10 units, safety stock 50 units in December
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Skill properly structured
- Progressive loading working

---

## Part 4: Copilot Memory and Diagnostics (20 minutes)

### Exercise 4.1: Use Copilot Memory (10 min)

**Task:** Store and retrieve BlueScope-specific standards

1. Enable Copilot Memory in VS Code settings if not already enabled.
- Select the settings icon in the bottom left corner of VS Code
- Search for "Copilot Memory"
- Enable the feature for both Tools and Chat and save settings

2. Open Copilot Chat and teach it BlueScope standards:
```
Remember: BlueScope uses the following standard locations:
- Warehouse-A: Hot-rolled products
- Warehouse-B: Cold-rolled and coated products
- Warehouse-C: Long products (bars, tubes)

Remember: Minimum stock levels by shape:
- Sheets: 100 units
- Coils: 50 units
- Plates: 75 units
- Bars: 200 units
- Tubes: 150 units

Remember: Our quality grades:
- Premium: aerospace, automotive
- Standard: construction, general manufacturing
- Economy: non-critical applications

Put these in repository memory.
```
Verify that a memory file is created.

3. Test memory recall. Open a new chat and ask:
```
What's the standard minimum stock level for sheets?
```

```
Where should I store hot-rolled coils?
```

4. Use memory in code generation:
```
Update the SteelProduct model to include quality_grade and set appropriate defaults based on what you remember
```

5. View your repository memory:
- Go to your repository on GitHub
- Click on Settings → Copilot → Memory
- Review the stored memories and their details
- You may also delete memories from this view if needed

**Expected Outcome:**
- Copilot recalls BlueScope-specific information
- Suggestions align with stored preferences
- Memory persists across chat sessions

---

### Exercise 4.2: Verify with Diagnostics View (10 min)

   - Review agent configurations
   - Test agent invocation

5. Check progressive loading:
```
@workspace Show me all available skills and their loading status
```

6. Debug any issues:
   - Check YAML frontmatter syntax
   - Verify file paths
   - Ensure proper indentation

**Expected Outcome:**
- All agents showing as active
- Skills properly loaded
- No warnings or errors in diagnostics

---

## Final Challenge: Build a Plan/Implement/Review Pipeline (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Create a complete coil quality grading feature using a structured Plan → Implement → Review workflow with a supporting skill.

### Context

BlueScope needs to implement an automated quality grading system for steel coils. The system must evaluate coils based on surface defects, dimensional accuracy, and coating uniformity, then assign a quality grade (Premium, Standard, or Economy).

### Task Overview

You will:
1. **Plan** the feature architecture and requirements
2. Create a **quality-grading skill** to encapsulate grading logic
3. **Implement** the quality grading endpoint and model changes
4. **Review** the implementation using Copilot's review capabilities
5. Test the complete workflow with your custom agents

---

### Step 1: Plan Phase (5 min)

Use decomposition prompting to plan the feature architecture:

1. Open a new Copilot Chat and ask:
```
I need to implement a coil quality grading feature for BlueScope's steel inventory API.
Let's plan this systematically:

1. First, what data fields do we need to track quality metrics for coils?
   Consider: surface defects, dimensional accuracy, coating uniformity

2. Then, what business logic determines the grade assignment?
   Use the grades from memory: Premium, Standard, Economy

3. Finally, what API endpoints and model changes are needed?
   Consider: grading endpoint, model updates, validation

Provide a structured plan with specific requirements for each component.
```

2. Review Copilot's plan and refine it by asking follow-up questions:
```
What validation rules should we apply to ensure data quality?
```

```
Should the grading be calculated automatically or manually triggered?
```

3. Document the plan for future reference and implementation guidance:
```
Save the complete plan in a markdown file called `coil-quality-grading-plan.md` in the project root.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Clear architectural plan documented
- Requirements broken down into implementable tasks
- Understanding of data flow and business logic

---

### Step 2: Create Quality Grading Skill (3 min)

Before implementing, create a reusable skill for the grading logic:

1. Ask Copilot:
```
/create-skill Create a quality-grading.skill in skills/quality-grading/SKILL.md that:
- Has proper YAML frontmatter (name: quality-grading, description)
- Defines grading criteria for steel coils based on:
  * Surface defect score (0-100, higher is better)
  * Dimensional accuracy percentage (0-100%)
  * Coating uniformity score (0-100)
- Includes grading rules:
  * Premium: All scores ≥ 95
  * Standard: All scores ≥ 80 and < 95
  * Economy: Any score < 80
- Provides usage examples for calculating grades
```

2. Verify the generated SKILL.md file in `skills/quality-grading/` directory (move it if needed)

3. Ensure the YAML frontmatter includes at minimum:
   - name: quality-grading
   - description: Clear explanation of coil quality grading

4. Test the skill immediately:
```
Use the quality-grading skill to determine the grade for a coil with:
- Surface defect score: 96
- Dimensional accuracy: 98%
- Coating uniformity: 97
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Reusable skill created following agentskills.io standard
- Grading logic clearly documented
- Skill responds correctly to test scenarios

---

### Step 3: Implement Phase (4 min)

Implement the feature using test-first development:

1. **Write tests first** - In Copilot Chat:
```
Using TDD, create comprehensive tests in tests/test_inventory.py for coil quality grading

Use the tests documented in coil-quality-grading-plan.md as a reference.

Use the quality-grading skill's rules for grade assignment logic.
```

2. **Update the model** - Ask Copilot:
```
Add quality metrics fields to the SteelProduct model in models.py:
- surface_defect_score: float (0-100)
- dimensional_accuracy: float (0-100)
- coating_uniformity: float (0-100)
- quality_grade: str (auto-calculated based on scores)

Include validation to ensure scores are within 0-100 range.
```

3. **Create the grading endpoint** - Ask Copilot:
```
Create a POST endpoint /inventory/{product_id}/grade in routers/inventory.py that:
- Accepts quality metrics (surface_defect_score, dimensional_accuracy, coating_uniformity)
- Calculates quality_grade using the quality-grading skill rules
- Updates the product record
- Returns the updated product with assigned grade

Use proper error handling for invalid product codes and out-of-range scores.
```

4. **Run tests in terminal**:
```bash
pytest tests/test_inventory.py -v
```

You may also ask Copilot test the changes done:
```
Test the coil quality grading implementation using test_inventory.py to ensure all tests pass and the grading logic is correct. Activate the environment first before running the tests.
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Tests written and passing
- Model updated with quality fields
- API endpoint functional
- Validation working correctly

---

### Step 4: Review Phase (2 min)

Use Copilot's review capabilities to validate your implementation:

1. **Comprehensive code review** - Open Copilot Chat and ask:
```
Review the coil quality grading implementation for:
- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Security considerations (input validation)
- Performance implications
- Documentation completeness

Focus on routers/inventory.py, models.py, and tests/test_inventory.py
```

2. **Review specific concerns**:
```
Are there any edge cases in the grading logic that aren't covered by tests?
```

```
Is the validation robust enough to prevent invalid data from being stored?
```

3. **Address any issues** found by Copilot using decomposition:
```
For the [issue found], let's fix it step by step:
1. First, explain why this is a problem
2. Then, suggest the best solution approach
3. Finally, show the implementation
```
> Note: You may skip this in the interest of time, but in a real scenario, you would want to address any critical issues found during the review.

**Expected Outcome:**
- Code reviewed and any issues identified
- Edge cases discovered and addressed
- Implementation validated against requirements

---

### Step 5: Integration Test with Custom Agents (1 min)

Test the complete workflow using your custom agents:

1. **Test with quality-inspector agent:**

Select the **quality-inspector** agent and ask:
```
Inspect this coil quality data and recommend a grade:
- Surface defect score: 92
- Dimensional accuracy: 88%
- Coating uniformity: 91

Does this meet our quality standards?
```

2. **Test with inventory-manager agent:**

Select the **inventory-manager** agent and ask:
```
Add a new coil to inventory:
- Product code: COIL-QA-001
- Shape: coil
- Grade: A36
- Location: Warehouse-B
Then grade it with: surface_defect_score=96, dimensional_accuracy=98, coating_uniformity=97
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Agents correctly handle quality grading context
- Integration works end-to-end
- Agents leverage the quality-grading skill appropriately
